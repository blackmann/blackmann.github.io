      Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to complete as many
      projects as you can to get good. These missions are fairly challenging and
      yes, you've never seen any these before.

    <p class="max-w-39rem text-secondary">
      Some missions may end up being beneficial to you â€” they become apps/utils
      you may use regularly yourself. Others will teach you the tech and how to
      reason about the solutions.
    </p>

    <p class="max-w-39rem text-secondary">
      For each mission, you'll be given a headstart â€” what tech to use, what
      documentations to read and how to plan. But most of it, you may need to
      figure out yourself.
