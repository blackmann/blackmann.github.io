          The Creative Challenge is an initiative to unlock and develop the
          creative potential of tertiary students through rewarding challenges ‚Äî
          in cash and in thrill.

        <p class="rounded-lg bg-zinc-200 px-2 py-1 dark:bg-neutral-800">
          The Creative Challenge is a programming competition currently open to
          anyone in KNUST. Not just <em>engineering</em> students.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every other week, we run competitions of varying difficulties and
          formats. On regular challenge weeks, winning teams or individuals get
          <code>700</code>, <code>400</code> or <code>200</code> cedis in cash rewards
          ‚Äî these are known as <code>Gala weeks</code>. On special challenge
          weeks, rewards are larger and more exciting. These weeks are known as <code>
            League week
          </code>.
        </p>

        <p>Refreshments üçπ are shared on any event week.</p>

        <p>
          We will however, host regular seminars to teach new tips, tricks and
          technologies to expand our knowledge domain.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <u>Creative Challenge</u> is open to anyone. For any event, anyone
          is welcome to attend and even invite friends. Though, you must register
          to attend any event. Venues may have limited capacity.
