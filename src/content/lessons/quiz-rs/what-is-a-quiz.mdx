import Fold from '../../../components/Fold.tsx'

## First, a question

A quiz has a number of questions. From design, each question has a title and an answer which can be true or false. We also need to be able to track if a question has been answered or not — to determine score and if the quiz is complete.

This helps us to arrive at the following data structure for a question:

```rust
struct Question {
  title: String,
  answer: bool,
  user_answer: Option<bool>
}
```

Put this piece of code in `quiz/src/quiz.rs`.

<Fold title="Current folder structure" subtitle="Compare to make sure you're on track" client:load>
Your folder structure should look like this now:

```bash
.
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
└── quiz
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src
        ├── main.rs
        └── quiz.rs
```
</Fold>

What is an `Option<>`? Why don't we just use `bool` for `user_answer`? This is because the user may not have answered the question yet. So we use `Option<>` to indicate that the value may or may not be present. We'll see how to use it later.

We need implement two methods on the `Question` struct to help us 1) know if the question has been answered and 2) know if the user's answer is correct.

```rust
// ^ struct Question { ... }

impl Question {
  fn is_answered(&self) -> bool {
    // `is_some` is a method on `Option<>` that tells us if
    // the `user_answer` is not `None`
    self.user_answer.is_some()
  }

  fn is_correct(&self) -> bool {
    // What is `Some`? Make a Google search 🤷🏽‍♂️?
    self.user_answer == Some(self.answer)
  }
}
```

Notice that the methods are supposed to return a `bool` but there's no `return` keyword. In Rust, the last statement[^1] of a function without termination (ie, `;`) is a return value.

[^1]: See https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-03-how-functions-work.html#functions-with-return-values

## Then a quiz

A quiz is a collection of questions and also tracks the current question.

```rust
struct Quiz {
  questions: Vec<Question>,
  // What is `usize`? Make a Google search 🤷🏽‍♂️?
  current_index: usize
}
```

Let's implement methods to

- get the current question
- move to the next question but only if the current question has been answered
- get the score of the quiz

Attempt to implement these methods yourself by referencing the `Question` methods above. If you get stuck or done, see/compare the solution below:


<Fold client:load title="Hint: Quiz Signature" subtitle="Click here to view the Quiz methods' signature. Implement them.">
```rust
// ^ struct Quiz { ... }

impl Quiz {
  fn current_question(&self) -> Question { }

  fn next_question(&mut self) -> Question {
  // watch out for index out of bounds
  }

  fn score(&self) -> usize { }
}

````
</Fold>

Here are some pointers:

- Iterator loops: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/loop-expr.html#iterator-loops

- Method syntax: [https://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v1.25/.../method-syntax.html](https://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v1.25/arch/amd64_ubuntu1404/share/doc/rust/html/book/first-edition/method-syntax.html). Watch out for mutable `self` references.

The following is a concrete implementation of the methods. You can compare with yours.

```rust
// ^ struct Quiz { ... }

impl Quiz {
  // Here we return a reference to the current question
  // else we'll be making a `move` which the compiler will complain
  // about.
  // Try to remove the `&` on this line and the next and see what happens.
  fn current_question(&self) -> &Question {
    &self.questions[self.current_index]
  }

  // &mut means mutable reference
  fn next_question(&mut self) -> &Question {
    let count = self.questions.len() - 1;
    if self.current_question().is_answered() && self.current_index < count {
      self.current_index += 1;
    }

    self.current_question()
  }

  fn score(&self) -> usize {
    // notice `mut`
    let mut correct = 0;
    for question in &self.questions {
      if question.is_correct() {
        correct += 1;
      }
    }

    correct
  }
}
````

`mut` is used to indicate that the variable can be mutated. In Rust, you have to be intentional about mutation.

## Exercise: more methods

You must have noticed we are missing some implementations. This is your exercise:

1. Implement a method to go to the previous question: `fn prev_question(&mut self) -> Question`
2. Implement a method to answer the current question. It should also return true/false if the answer is correct or not: `fn answer(&mut self, answer: bool) -> bool`

We'll test our implementation in the next lesson.
