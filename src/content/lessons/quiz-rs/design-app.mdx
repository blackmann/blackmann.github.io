import QuizUIDesign from '../../../components/QuizUIDesign.astro'

I always like to draw wireframes to visualize my app so I can come up with requirements. It makes things clearer and easier to attack the objectives.

I spent some time coming up with the following design. But you can be creative and come up with yours. The chapters on [Layouting](layout) and [Styling](styling) will help achieve whatever you come up with.

<div class="bg-zinc-50 rounded-lg dark:(bg-neutral-800 bg-opacity-50) p-2 mb-2">
  <QuizUIDesign />
</div>

> You can use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) to do something similar.

We'll need to restrict the width and height of our app else we're going to have lots of empty space which won't look good.

## Specifications

- Our quiz app is going to show the question number in the format (1/3) where 1 is the current question and 3 is the total number of questions.

- The question is going to be shown in the middle of the screen.

- The user can select either true or false.

- The user can only go to the next question if they have answered the current question. They can go back to the previous question at any time.

- When a question is answered, the user should be shown whether they got the question right or wrong immediately.
