We can all agree, our app is not looking good. If you don't care about looks, I think we're done here. Else, let's ge'it.

If you remember, from our [design](design-app), we need to restrict the width and height of our app. Let's update our [`NativeOptions`](https://docs.rs/eframe/latest/eframe/struct.NativeOptions.html) in `main`:

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), eframe::Error> {
    let viewport = egui::ViewportBuilder::default().with_inner_size(egui::Vec2::new(300.0, 400.0));

    let options = eframe::NativeOptions{
      viewport,
      // This is a common pattern in Rust. See below
      ..Default::default()
    };

    eframe::run_native("Queeez", options, Box::new(|ctx| Box::new(App::new())))
}
```

  This [document](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/default/trait.Default.html) does a good job of explaining the `Default` trait. Please read it.

  However, in our code above, we're using the `..` operator to copy the rest of the fields from the default `NativeOptions` struct. This is a common pattern in Rust. It's called [Struct update syntax](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html#creating-instances-from-other-instances-with-struct-update-syntax).

  In simpler words, we're creating a new `NativeOptions` instance with the default values and then overriding just the `viewport` field with our own value.
</Fold>

This will make the app launch with a 300 x 400 window. But you'll be able to resize the window. We don't want that. Your exercise is to look throught the [`ViewportBuilder`](https://docs.rs/egui/0.25.0/egui/viewport/struct.ViewportBuilder.html) docs and find a way to disable resizing.

Next step is to put some space between the previous and next buttons so that each button is on opposite sides of the window horizontally.

<div class="bg-zinc-50 rounded-lg dark:(bg-neutral-800 bg-opacity-50) p-2">
  <SpaceBetweenPrevNext />
</div>

`egui` does not have a built-in way to do something like [`justify-between`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/justify-content#space-between). So we'll have to finesse it.

The way to do that is to:

1. create two columns
2. justify the first column naturally (left to right)
3. justify the second column in reverse (right to left)
4. render each button in its own column

Replace the part of the code that renders the next and previous buttons with the following:

```rust
ui.columns(2, |columns| {
  columns[0].allocate_ui_with_layout(
    egui::Vec2 { x: 120.0, y: 40.0 },
    egui::Layout::left_to_right(egui::Align::Center),
    |ui| {
      if ui.button("previous").clicked() {
          self.quiz.previous();
      }
    },
  );

  columns[1].allocate_ui_with_layout(
    egui::Vec2 { x: 120.0, y: 40.0 },
    egui::Layout::right_to_left(egui::Align::Center),
    |ui| {
      if ui.button("next").clicked() {
          self.quiz.next();
      }
    },
  );
})
```

Good now.

On to some styling.
