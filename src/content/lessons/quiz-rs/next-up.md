I hope you had fun and feel accomplished. What are your impressions about the language so far? Do you think it's something you'll like to try out in the future? If it's all positive, then read on.

## What next?

First, share your progress with me on Twitter [@_yogr](https://twitter.com/_yogr) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/5CDnysz). I'm really interested in what you've done.

Rust is a general purpose language. Meaning you can use it for a lot of things. Building UIs is one of them. Though, the GUI ecosystem is still figuring things out. This means you won't find mature libraries/frameworks like you would in other languages.

If you'll like to be just fluent with language and have a handle on it, I suggest you pick up [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings). It's a collection of small exercises that will help you get familiar with the language.

You should also join the [Rust Discord](https://discord.gg/rust-lang) server. It's a great place to ask questions and get help. There's also the [Rust subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/).
