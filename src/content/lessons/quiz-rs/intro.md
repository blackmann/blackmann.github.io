This is a quick course to show you that Rust is just a beautiful language and after you're done [with this course], you may want to use it for anything. A lot of introductory materials on learning Rust are mostly command-line applications. If you learned to program applications with HTML/CSS/Javascript, it's natural that you crave tutorials that are visual.

You've come to the right place. This course does not require you to have used Rust before. However, you should have programmed in another language â€” any language.

## The language

Rust is a statically typed language. A lot of us have grown to like types so this shouldn't be a problem. If you come from a dynamically typed language like Javascript, Python, Ruby, etc. and don't know what **static typing** means, this is a quick explanation: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1517670/4803261
