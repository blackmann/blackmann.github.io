import Fold from '../../../components/Fold.tsx'

Let's put a face to the name.

We'll use `egui` to create the interface for our app. `egui` is an [immediate mode GUI](https://collquinn.gitlab.io/portfolio/my-article.html) library for Rust.

<Fold title="Immediate mode" subtitle="What does that mean?" client:load>
  Immediate mode GUI is a paradigm where the GUI is drawn every frame. This is
  in contrast to the more common retained mode GUI where the GUI is built once
  and then updated as needed.

You can think of immediate mode GUI as the kind that you'd see in a game. If you've used HTML5 Canvas, you've used immediate mode GUI.

This means that the code you're going to write for your UI are all going to be ran every frame. This is a bit different from how you might be used to writing UI code.

</Fold>

Here's a website demonstrating the power of `egui`: https://egui.rs

Yupp, the demos run in the browser! Because `egui` can compile to WebAssembly. This means that you can build your app for the web and desktop with the same codebase.

Inside `quiz/Cargo.toml`, add the following to the `[dependencies]` section:

```toml
[dependencies]
eframe = "0.24.1"
egui = "0.24.1"
```

In `quiz/src`, replace the `main` function with the following:

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), eframe::Error> {
    println!("Hello, world!"); // [!code --]
    let options = eframe::NativeOptions::default();
    eframe::run_native("Queeez", options, Box::new(|ctx| Box::new(App::new())))
}
```

I'll advise that you don't stress too much about what all of those mean right now. Label it (in your mind) as boilerplate. In fact, that piece of code is copied from: https://docs.rs/eframe/latest/eframe/#usage-native.

## Documentation

In Rust, most of libraries' documentation are in the form of examples than in natural language. So you should get used to reading examples; and knowing how to find/modify them. A lot of libraries have an `examples/` directory in their repository. Always check them out.

## App

When you save `main.rs` after adding the code above, you should get an error that `App` is not defined. Let's define it:

```rust
struct App { }

impl App {
  fn new() -> Self {
    Self {}
  }
}

```

Now, you should get an error that `App` doesn't implement `egui::app::App`. Let's do that:

```rust
// yes, this is another impl block
// in Typescript, this would be: `class App implements eframe::app::App`
impl eframe::App for App {
  fn update(&mut self, ctx: &egui::Context, frame: &mut eframe::Frame) {
    egui::CentralPanel::default().show(ctx, |ui| {
      ui.label("Hello world!");
    });
  }
}
```

<Fold title="egui:: eframe::" subtitle="Huh? What are those?" client:load>
  Prefixing symbols (ie, functions, structs, etc.) with the name of the library they belong to is a common practice in Rust. This is to avoid name collisions. For example, there's a `Vec` in the standard library and there's also a `Vec` in the `egui` library. So to use the one in the standard library, you'd do: `std::vec::Vec`. And to use the one in `egui`, you'd do: `egui::vec::Vec`.

  But when you're sure you may not end up with collisions or you're using a symbol very often, you can bring them to scope by doing something like the following at the top of your file:

  ```rust
  use egui::{CentralPanel, CtxRef};

  // then you can use them without the prefix
  // egui::CentralPanel -> CentralPanel
  // egui::CtxRef -> CtxRef
  ```

  Try that!

  Throughout the course, I'll be using the prefix to make it clear where a symbol is coming from. But you can use the `use` statement to bring them to scope.
</Fold>

Run your code to see what you've done. Forgotten how to run a bin? See [Chapter 3: Create project](./create-project#run).

## UI

Scrap the `ui.label("Hello world!");` line. Let's create our UI:

```rust
egui::CentralPanel::default().show(ctx, |ui| {
  ui.label("1/10");
  ui.label("What is the capital of Nigeria?");

  ui.horizontal(|ui| {
    ui.button("True");
    ui.button("False");
  });

  ui.horizontal(|ui| {
    ui.button("Previous");
    ui.button("Next");
  });
});
```

Run the app to see what it looks like: `cargo run -p quiz`.

Next we're going to handle states and logic for our app.
