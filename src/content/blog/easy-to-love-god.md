It's easier to love God and that's what people want. To love God, it's simple.

Go to place of worship consistently.

Pay dues and offering per your strength.

Pray.

Don't speak ill of God.

Encourage others to love God.

Which of these are so hard to do? In fact, people box all of those and call it "doing the will of God".

But let me show you what's harder, loving people. Loving humans. Especially people that don't _belong_ to us — strangers, people of other religious beliefs, etc. We all know the pain that comes with love so where does the fulfilment lie when we love God. Is it the fact that other people (who claim to love God) can see our efforts in doing same?

But love, with its social meaning, can be extreme. So lets tone it down to compassion. Wherever you saw the word love, replace with compassion; and from here onwards.

Love (or like we've toned down to compassion) is treating others like you would to yourself. Or the very least, not causing other people pain and grief — without cause.

I have personally been a victim so many times to people who claim to love God. I bet you also have — approximately half of the time without your provocation. Overpricing of goods, deliberate irresponsibility, backbiting, false-accusations, etc. And you'd have days turn into weeks and then into months and never sense any form of remorse from them lest an apology.

We will try to resist any attempt by people trying to do any of those to us.

> That is war.

But guess what, we can never do these bad things to God even if we tried.

Because, it's easier to love God.
