I recently turned 27. I'm growing older and there's this fascination of raising a younger me — a child. Not that I'm actually ready for this but the idea is actually exciting.

The idea of playing games with this little one. Teaching him/her how to draw, how to write, how to use [Blender](https://blender.org) and make cool visual artworks.

The idea of challenging each other and beating[^1] them all the time. Making sure he/she realizes their ultimate potential.

[^1]: I mean winning

Teaching this little one to be compassionate. To put the continuity and well-being of humanity first.

The idea that once in a while I can pull off some tricks to wow him/her. Sometimes, some cool handshakes, some origami, backflips[^2], what-not. Jokes only both of us understand.

[^2]: Can't do this now, but will definitely figure it out.

Ultimately, this person will have a better chance and support to making the world a better place than I got.

And a best friend.

Though it might sound like it's all about him/her, it's about me too. I'd want to be a super-dad. Not one that just _provides_ but one that is a role-model to this child.

I'm obviously not ignorant about the inevitable pain, disappointment and difficulties this will come with — just like anything else.
