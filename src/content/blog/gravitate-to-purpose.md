Comfort, wanting to live with very few problems, is a trap into complacency, stagnation, and feeling less fulfilled. Comfort on its own is a very good thing. But choosing comfort as a guiding principle leads to chaos.

Comfort is that thing that would make you stay in a job that pays steadily and well but does little to improve your skills nor your career.

Comfort is that thing that would make you stay away from learning new technologies, languages, and frameworks because what you know now works.

Comfort is that thing that would make you choose quick and easy methods that are short-term to solve problems. Sometimes comfort means to avoid the problems altogether.

Comfort suppresses creativity.

Comfort requires you to avoid difficult conversations and decisions.

Comfort breeds disorder.

Comfort sends you down.

Let's talk about purpose for a moment:

Purpose, having a reason to live, is the force that keeps people in motion for growth, progress, and fulfillment.

Purpose keeps you busy.

Purpose makes you learn and fuels creativity.

Purpose will wake you up in the morning.

Purpose sends you up.

Where comfort says stop, purpose says keep going!
