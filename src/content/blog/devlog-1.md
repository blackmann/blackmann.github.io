It's been two months since I left my last job. Reason being: I wasn't creatively challenged enough. I felt the pressure from the people I look up to (on Twitter, Github, etc.) People doing cool stuff! I am a _creative_ and I feel tortured when I don't create enough.

> I've always found time to do something creative while I was working fulltime though.

During these two months, I am experiencing a large burst of motivation and creativity. I have been able to get myself together to do things I want any time without worrying about interruptions from work. You can say I have the freedom of time; which is critical to the success of a creative life/career. I've been a lot more happier.

> Note that I'm financially strong to be able to afford this free time. I don't advise quitting your job when you don't have means to feed.

## My homepage

I've reworked my homepage as a stage for many cool things to come. See my notes here: [I did it again. I had to.](/blog/preface)

## Projects I'm working on

- Stylebender: A no-code style editor (for web developers). See notes here: [stylebender: Speeding my web workflow](/blog/stylebender). It's also opensource.

- Low-code backend development framework. Yes! Just another framework. Not a lot of details right now, but hopefully I can talk about it in the next devlog. Stylebender needed to be completed to help aid in this project.

- #Drive clone. I'm very passionate about WebGL. This project is an attempt to remake [the endless driving game](https://www.drive.game). This will offer me the opportunity to learn a lot of things about game dev ‚Äî this time, for the web.

## Drawing üñåÔ∏è

If you're following me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_yogr), you'll notice that I'm killing it. As a kid, I used to draw a lot. And sometimes from memory. It's been so many years since I did any serious drawings. It's time to pick it back.
