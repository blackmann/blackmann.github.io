This is some quick point of view I shared in my Discord:

I've really been reconsidering AI recently. And I'm realizing, the state of AI now does not encourage self-improvement.

It raises the question: "why learn, when you can prompt". More difficult: beginners are not sure it's worth learning anymore.

But let's assume _generative_ AI came out about 10 years ago. This time, there was no tailwind. We would agree the code produced by AI would have made use of sass (because this was close to writing fewer css). Would there have been the incentive to develop tailwind?

The hype and advocacy for AI now suggests that, the state of HOW we create things have reached its peak. AI is only leveraging up to this peak.

But most of these frameworks, libraries, languages are inherently flawed. And we (as humans) naturally tend to be _creative_ to get around all of that. That is where the fun and fulfillment comes from.

AI suggests, it's the result that matters.

Besides that, I've realized given how AI is designed, it always puts you in the common. ie, The results you get are the higher probabilities of what a lot of people have accepted, less what's correct/right.

So you'll realize, a lot of the fascination is around how the output of AI looks familiar to something we've seen before and **wish** we could have done easily.

But when it comes to entirely new ideas, new/different aesthetics, which I constantly find myself doing, AI hasn't really been helpful to me.

I would be going back to VS Code (away from cursor)

Now, that's an creative point of view. Not everyone is in it for the creativity. A lot (higher proportion) are in for the money â€” I'm not sharing that view.
